Exchange rates represent the currency value of one country compared to another. They are determined by the foreign exchange market based on supply and demand dynamics. Predicting exchange rates is crucial for businesses and financial institutions, but it is challenging due to their noisy, non-stationary, and chaotic nature. Traditional time series analysis methods are not effective for finance-related data. Therefore, Neural Networks (NN) have been explored as an alternative solution for exchange rate forecasting.
